# IP Community

In the 7th workshop on Induced Polarization (IP) in Lund, May 26-28, 2024, we had some nice discussions on 
* comparability of different processing and inversion algorithms
* providing an overview on existing software, their potential and limitations
* creating benchmark models to test software on
* a collection of (already published) data sets with existing reference data to test existing or future codes
* formats and requirements for storing IP data in a sustainable way

To start discussion and collection, we are creating several public repositories to that everyone in the community can contribute. Join the community!
